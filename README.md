# hello-world
LET'S GET IT!
I am currently in the process of starting my own business with a good friend of mine, we will be fixing electronics... such as phones, tablets/ipads, computers/Macs, laptops/macbooks, etc. Software(rooting/jailbreaking,bypasses,factory reset,unlocking,etc.) AND hardware(replacing screens,camera,wifi,ports,etc.) I want to know everything possible in this industry.
